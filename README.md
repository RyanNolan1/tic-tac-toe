# The Odin Project - tic-tac-toe / Santa vs Sprouts

This is the tic-tac-toe game section of The Odin Project. I decided to give it a Christmas theme since it was created in the lead-up to Christmas, and it is now called 'Santa vs Sprouts!' I learned a lot while working on this project, including the use of factory functions, IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), JavaScript modules, and the importance of keeping as much code as possible out of the global scope.
